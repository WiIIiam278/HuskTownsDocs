**HuskTowns** is a simple bungee-compatible Towny-style protection plugin for SpigotMC Minecraft servers. The plugin lets players form towns and claim land chunks on your server to protect them from grief. With a beautiful chat interface, easy to use commands - not to mention the ability for everything to work across multiple servers on a bungee network - your players will love using HuskTowns on your server.
